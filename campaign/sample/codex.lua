"To each its own"
 
This polity seems to have started as a defensive alliance, as the old empire was falling apart. Many systems in the region had long-suppressed desires for independence, and banded together to maintain a semblance of order in the slow disappearance of imperial law. With time, trade and law enforcement agreements completed the military treaties, and the Union slowly became a political entity in its own right, if a very decentralized one constituted of fiercely autonomous members.
 
As it grew in size and strength it began to run into opposition, both over territory and ideology. This drove them to create an unified military and foreign service, with the occasional bout of expansionism. It seems to have fared relatively well, until they were faced with a much stronger enemy against whom they started to lose system after system.
 
With the enemy at the gates there was little hope of repelling them without of a miracle. Evidently no miracle occurred.]]

The origin of this relatively new power is unclear. They claim that, as the previous empire disintegrated, it retained its traditions and a core of systems, from which it started to rebuild and reassert itself. The Empire claimed the legitimacy of its grand conquest by naming it a reclamation of its rightful place as the sole ruler of the galaxy. Unsurprisingly, their enemies would have less flattering 'official histories', the most popular being that an ambitious warlord conquered the fallen empire's homeworlds before having delusions of grandeur.
 
Whatever the truth is, they did retain many of the traditions of the previous empire, even using its legal system and political organization as a basis for their own. By the force of arms, they managed to slowly but surely conquer the galaxy again, with more and more resources and autonomy given to their formidable military machine. At the height of its power only a few factions were offering resistance the Empire, and even those had little hope of repelling their armies.]]

With so much of the Empire's efforts diverted toward the armies and expansion, it appears to have neglected the grievances of many worlds within its domain. As unrest grew across the Empire, both on wealthy peripheral worlds and poor, isolated ones, mostly caused by the diversion of resources towards the war machine, the rule of law became both harsher and less effective at keeping order.
 
The ruling council of the Empire thought they could retain enough authority to prevent any serious challenge to their rule, at least for long enough to finish pacifying the galaxy. It appears they were wrong.
 
Several uprisings erupted on key worlds throughout the Empire. Unprepared to combat such a large rebellion, and faced with an enemy relying more on subversion and deception than military control of territory, it quickly lost control of entire regions. The Empire was prompt to turn its war machine inward and crush the rebellion by the force of arms, as daunting a task as it was.
 
The goal of the Rebels was not direct victory so much as mortally injuring the Empire from the inside, and holding on long enough to see a liberated galaxy. What plans they did have for the aftermath are unclear, given how many disparate groups participated. However, for such coordinated uprisings to take place, a central organization had to be overseeing it. Was it an ad-hoc coalition of mutually hostile forces against a greater common enemy, or did they have their own agenda?]]

As the previous galactic order fell apart, many long-repressed sectarian tensions flared, particularly between free machines and biosupremacists. As conflicts increased in violence, a self-defense group of free machines carved a safe-haven for themselves, before harboring more endangered groups and allying with other self-defense groups as time went by and the whole region slid into anarchy.
 
During the interregnum, they slowly built up their territory and influence, until they became a regional hegemon. This put them in rivalry with the Union over both strategic and ideological points, having become a highly centralized, harmonist regime. This cold war marred by proxy conflicts was only ended by the greater threat of the Empire.
 
Realizing that even their uneasy alliance with the Union would not be enough to repel the Empire, they threw every resource they had into the defensive effort, hoping to either outlast the Empire, or maybe find another avenue to victory entirely.

At the time of the event, they were slowly losing ground, holding onto strategic points with all their strength and making the Empire pay a surprisingly heavy toll for each conquered world. Given their tight organization, formidable defenses and the series of strategic choke-points that were their last worlds, they might have held out for a very long time.]]

Something about the Rebels had been nagging me for a long time. They were too well-prepared, well-organized, and managed to coordinate simultaneous uprisings among groups of malcontents that often hated each-other. And something about their whole modus operandi kept reminding me of something.

As it turns out, it appears that the Dynasty was behind it all. The oldest known organization in the galaxy, they were thought to have been destroyed by the Anarchai at the fall of Chatka, millennia before. Somehow, they appear to have survived.
 
Tracing back to Earth, they were a shadowy group of biosupremacists, obsessed with creating superior humans through genetic and biological modifications, and ruling over humanity as its greatest representatives. They shunned cybernetic enhancements, and hated non-human synths and free machines as anathema. They were divided into rival families, united only in their goal and against common menaces.
 
They only acted openly when they were certain of their strength, preferring to subvert those they could, and secretly organizing rebellions against those they couldn't. They were the puppetmasters behind the Rebels, hoping to destabilize the Empire and take over in the resulting chaos. Even if the Empire won, it would have been weakened enough for the Dynasty to grow in influence - assuming they had not been discovered.

Their discoverers decided to keep the secret of the vault to themselves, and to use the vast amount data preseved within to recreate the Dynasty.

Despite meticulous planning, the rebellion they set against the Empire was rushed and proved too difficult to manage, leading ultimately to its failure. While it did help destabilize the Empire, I have the feeling that the ancient Dynasty, with their immense experience and institutional memory, would have fared much better, possibly well enough to emerge on the stage directly.

Taken aback, the Celestial Dominion, Ghost Mandate and Dynasty put their longstanding cold war on hold to band together against this new menace, but to no avail. Within months, both the mighty Ghost Fleet and the Four Thrones had been destroyed, with only a few survivors managing to reach Dynasty space before the Anarchai scattershapes.

Fortunately, there is no programming for interplanetary or interstellar contamination, even when space-capable hardware is infected - which often degrades too fast to be capable of reaching other worlds in any cases, so quarantine is effective as containment method.

They tried to keep it secret from rival families, recognizing correctly that they would not accept being displaced by Humans 2.0, but they ended up being discovered.

How strange to find out the whole truth, after all this time.
 
This was the homeworld of the new Dynasty. Even after centuries, the discoverers of the vault were still but children compared to their legendary forebears - but they were driven by the same fire. Obsessed by creating superior humans, humans worthy of ruling the galaxy, they pursued a project of engineering the ultimate human warrior. Their goal, a new Demiurge army that would conquer all of humanity in one glorious campaign, and reign as its true, natural, lords!
 
They didn't tell us what we were. Were they wary of leaks? Of how it might twist us? Of losing control over us? We only knew we were a new type of modified human, and a bright future was waiting for us. Sent to military academies, we all performed reasonably well. But reasonably well wasn't what they were hoping for. In truth, we were well-made, we were as capable without biomods or implants as the best cyborgs and synths, but we were no Demiurges.
 
Sometimes, when we went for checkups, some of us didn't come back - particularly those of us found underperforming. Sudden sickness, we were told. Unplanned complications, to be expected from a first batch. No need to worry, statistics were with us now. These lingering defects had been fixed. Unfortunate for those they couldn't have saved.
 
They knew we were growing suspicious, and it made them panic. They decided that the entire generation were to be recalled, to be destructively analyzed, and hoped to do better next time.
 
Ironically, they had underestimated us. At the next checkup, seeing the changes in procedure and nigh-imperceptible nervousness of our attendants, we knew what to expect. And we had long since prepared escape plans.
 
As for me, I had been separated and cornered when I felt something connect to my mind. As it turns out, I was enough of a Demiurge for an ancient Dynasty Commander, as, after proving impervious to all attempts at analysis and control, it was responding to me. Powering up in the middle of its laboratory, with security half-compromised, it easily tore through several perimeters straight to my position.
 
Once on board, I managed to commandeer a dropship and take control of the Commander's support starship. I must have been the priority target by this point as, right before I could jump out-system, the planetry defense grid scored a hit on my hyperdrive generator.
 
The resulting misjump should have dismantled the starship and its hold into constituent atoms, but this was a starship built with the expertise of the ancient Dynasty in its final days. Somehow, the ship managed to channel the energies of an exploding hyperdrive into a jump halfway across the galaxy, landing me in deep space near a Union system-state.
 
The Union salvage teams never realized there was a pilot on board the Commander: the shock had been so harsh, I had to have been put into deep hibernation, to be awakened in an adequately-equipped Demiurge medical facility. So, not knowing what this strange technology was, they sent us to Folsom to be stored and studied at a later date...
 
Here, after our escape attempt, and with me fleeing so violently, the hidden heirs of the Dynasty knew the Empire would investigate. They knew it was too early to show their hand, but they had just run out of time.

In the ancient times, a young Ghost Mandate stumbled upon a discovery made by a forgotten galactic power, something called the Eternity Gate.
 
An immense hyperspace structure, almost half as large as the galaxy, spans the near-starless expanse just beyond the tip of the Mandate Arm. In its heart exists a rift that connects to the other end of the universe, both across space and time. A complex, diaphanous structure had been built, spanning many systems, to serve as a jump amplifier and reach for the rift. The Mandate restored it and, carefully, began to explore it.
 
After millennia, they received their first reports from the other side. Their first surprise was at the time shift: for days on this side, barely a second would pass on the other - which had only been the first of many hurdles in their attempts to transmit data back. It had been theorized that as both ends drifted toward each-other time-wise, so would they in space, until they would meet and disappear in an impossibly distant future. Or this was the point of their birth, sending them drifting backwards in time...
 
The other surprise was that the other end, despite being long past the heat death of the universe, and across a mangled, nearly incomprehensibly distorted space-time, was somewhat inhabitable. And, it would seem, possibly inhabited.
 
Further investigation was cut short when the Anarchai overran the galaxy, severing the Mandate Arm from fallback Dynasty worlds. Faced with destruction, local Mandate authorities strengthened the Gate to the point that it could support a mass-exodus, and evacuated as many as they could.
 
It had long been thought that the Anarchai had destroyed the Gate itself, but strangely enough, only the control system was damaged. Somehow, the Empire found a way to rebuild it. And as the Mandate before them, they fled across the Gate.
 
When the survivors arrived, the Eternity Gate was fully operational, and they all crossed it successfully, in the end. But now, after such a long time, it has fallen into disrepair - I restored what self-repair systems I could, but it will be decades, maybe centuries before it can be crossed again.
 
Maybe I will tidy up what I can in this galaxy. Maybe there are others like me, still waiting in deep slumber. And I can always skip time in hibernation, if needs be.
 
~~
 
It seems the Empire also found an incomplete Mandate project. They lacked the time to study it in detail, but they thought it was a receptor node, intended to invert the Gate operation and guide backward jumps across the rift. Let's see what I can make of it...]]

This strategy appeared to work, in a sense, as there was little the occupying force could do beyond quell uprising after uprising. The habitability of the planet was apparently a price the combatants were willing to pay.

In a strange turn of fate, the human-supremacist Dynasty, oldest and longest-lived political force in the galaxy, would hold the last bastion of the free galaxy against the alien-thinking Anarchai supermachines.
 
Faced with annihilation, not only of themselves but of the entire galaxy, the Dynasty renounced its founding principle. They installed Celestial cybernetic enhancements on their Demiurge battalion, creating in desperation what would be the greatest warriors in galactic history, and the only ones to ever stand their ground, if only for a moment, against the Anarchai.
 
They would hold for two years, repelling many planetary assaults, but losing almost as many Demiurges to late cybernetic incompatibilities than to enemy action. Ultimately, though, it was not the Demiurges that would fail. Concentrating all their forces on the lone system, the Anarchai shut down the system's hyperspace barriers and triggered a starpulse, destroying all space defenses. Then sent their siege clusters to break the planetary shield, overwhelm the anti-aerospace defenses, and burn the planet to the mantle.

This turned out to be a mistake.
 
While the newly-unified Rebel military was adept at raids and information warfare, they had little experience in large-scale frontal combat. In launching such an attack, the Rebel Expeditionary Force pitted their own weaknesses against the Empire's key strength. Having long since prepared for such an eventuality, the Second Home Army used the string of fortress worlds as a bottleneck, to force the Rebel forces into a decisive battle at Karuwal. Against superiorly trained forces with, for once, the home advantage, the Rebel Expeditionary Force suffered a catastrophic defeat from which only a few survivors managed to retreat.
 
The loss of the army into which the Rebels had poured so much of their resources broke their military, and it would never recover. Following this defeat, and despite occasional successes in resisting the Empire's advance, the Rebels would not see another key victory, only losing ground from then on.

Well...
 
This was the Anarchai homeworld. The founders of what would become Haven discovered it as the old Empire was crumbling away - the whole thing started as an archeotech effort, in fact. This would certainly explain Haven's obsession with the Anarchai. Whether they were afraid of what they would find, or whether they were simply paranoid, they did their best to keep the whole thing secret. Which included turning the entire continent into a high-activity military exercise area, both to cover up their archeotech activities and have convenient armies to deal with interlopers.
 
Most of the archives I could find are extremely well-encrypted, but the little I could decipher indicates that even after all that time, they still had more questions than answers. The Anarchai themselves apparently destroyed a lot of evidence of their origins when they remade themselves.
 
The progenitors of the Anarchai were originally were a small technologist settlement, exploring cybernetic and free machine self-modifications on a remote world, both to avoid what they saw as stifling regulations, and in case something went wrong to the point of quarantine.

The entire strategy revolved around forcing a battle for the control of the planet to take place there, where collateral damage would be held to a minimum.
Ironically, their capital was the only world over which they were not ready to fight to the death. All their plans revolved over delaying actions and massive evacuations to the Zhurou redoubt.

They found out how to maintain them, even repairing some of the less decrepit non-functioning ones. But while the theoretical principles behind their operation became better and better understood, they were still far from even thinking about building a new one from scratch.]]

Unfortunately for them, defenses and military experiments had been left as well. In particular, one Detriment that was being used as a test platform had simply reverted to its original configuration and let loose, apart from extensive self-repair and maintenance upgrades...
 
Supposedly just a standard Empire R&D site, it had actually been infiltrated by Rebels, and used for research the Empire would never have approved of - such as military human genetic modifications beyond anything deemed acceptable by modified or augmented, let alone xenoform. Hardly a surprise though, considering who was behind the Rebels.]]

Some early hypotheses proposed extragalactic origin, but additional data confirmed a spread pattern constistent with emmination from a specific region of the galaxy, not propagated from a distant source.
 
It propagated through the arm in a matter of days, but slowed considerably by the time it reached the Inner Disc. Its progression then became asymmetric, progressing through the Celestial Arm in an estimated two weeks - though precise timing was unavailible due to the ongoing conflict with the Union followed by a loss of communication as its progress split the Empire. The wavefronts themselves appeared to disrupt hyperspace in a way that made interstellar communication, let alone travel, impossible through their wake.
 
Both the Inner Disc and Dynastic Quadrant went dark over in a matter of months. By that time, the Empire had ordered a total evacuation towards the Mandate Arm, hoping that at least some worlds would be spared as the advance slowed down. However, later calculations showed that Cipher, the furthest world that they could reach, would be overtaken five to fifteen years later.
 
They found no way of resist or bypass it, nor even of slowing it down. The automated systems continued taking data after it hit Lalata, but the remaining people never found a way to recover it across the event's wake.]]

Both wealth and battles of the ancient days also left it with more archeotech than any other quadrant. This again was both boon and bane, offering incredible opportunities and terrifying risks alike to those bold enough to unearth those artefacts.
 
It is said that Earth was located somewhere in this quadrant, as well as, more often than not, the base of operations of the ancient, secretive Dynasty.
